Melange, or spice, is the most valuable - and rarest - element in the universe; a drug that does everything from increasing a persons life-span to making intersteller travel possible. And it can only be found on a single planet: the inhospitable desert world Arrakis. Whoever controls Arrakis controls the spice. And whoever controls the spice controls the universe. When the Emperor transfers stewardship of Arrakis from the noble House Harkonnen to House Atreides, the Harkonnens fight back, murdering Duke Leto Atreides. Paul, his son, and Lady Jessica, his concubine, flee into the desert. On the point of death, they are rescued by a band for Fremen, the native people of Arrakis, who control Arrakis second great resource: the giant worms that burrow beneath the burning desert sands. In order to avenge his father and retake Arrakis from the Harkonnens, Paul must earn the trust of the Fremen and lead a tiny army against the innumerable forces aligned against them. And his journey will change the universe.');

Travel writer Lea Sutter finds herself on a small island off the coast of South Carolina, at the wrong place at the wrong time, and barely escapes with her life when a freak hurricane cuts through the island. In the storms aftermath, she discovers two orphaned boys—twins—and impulsively decides to adopt them. The boys seem amiable and immensely grateful; Leas family is not quite so pleased. But no one could anticipate the twins true nature—or predict that within a few weeks time, Leas husband, a controversial child psychologist, will be implicated in two brutal murders.
